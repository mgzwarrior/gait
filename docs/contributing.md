## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity** - The code should be simple and easy to understand. This is
   the most important principle. If you are not sure if your code is simple
   enough, ask for a review.
   - **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
2. **Consistency** - The code should be consistent with the rest of the codebase.
   This means that it should follow the same coding style, use the same
   terminology, and use the same patterns as the rest of the codebase.
3. **Completeness** - The code should be complete. This means that it should
   handle all possible cases, and should not leave any edge cases unhandled.
4. **Correctness** - The code should be correct. This means that it should
   produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
5. **Efficiency** - The code should be efficient. This means that it should
   produce the correct output in the least amount of time and space possible.
6. **Robustness** - The code should be robust. This means that it should handle
   all possible errors and exceptions gracefully.
7. **Testability** - The code should be testable. This means that it should be
   easy to write tests for the code.
8. **Extensibility** - The code should be extensible. This means that it should
   be easy to add new features to the code.
9. **Modularity** - The code should be modular. This means that it should be
   easy to reuse the code in other projects.
10. **Maintainability** - The code should be maintainable. This means that it
    should be easy to maintain the code in the long run.
11. **Portability** - The code should be portable. This means that it should
    work on all platforms and environments.
12. **Security** - The code should be secure. This means that it should not
    contain any security vulnerabilities.
13. **Documentation** - The code should be documented. This means that it should
    be easy to understand the code without reading the code itself.
14. **Readability** - The code should be readable. This means that it should be
    easy to read and understand the code.
15. **Scalability** - The code should be scalable. This means that it should be
    easy to scale the code to handle large amounts of data.
